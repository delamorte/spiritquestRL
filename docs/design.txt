SpiritQuest RL

Spirit Quest is a roguelike/adventure/rpg hybrid, based on Roguelike Tutorial Revised and jcerise's roguelike tutorial. The development is in a very early stage, so a lot of the design may still change. Both tiles and ascii are supported currently.

Here are some main features:

- Travel between two worlds, a 'dream world' and the waking world
- Adventure in dream worlds in the form of a spirit animal
- Encounter new animals and creatures and learn their forms and skills
- Use skills learned from spirit animals to explore a temple in the waking world
- Gain spirit power and insight by adventuring in dreams
- Explore the waking world to find ways to shape your dreams
- Try to gain enough insight to reveal the secrets of the temple and ascend
- Permadeath and procedurally generated dungeons

Backstory & lore:

The player takes the role of a Shaman on a spiritual retreat, who is trying to achieve his personal spirit quest. The Shaman's search has led him to an old temple with which he feels spiritually connected, and he has set up camp nearby. As he gains more spirit power and insight by meditating, he is able to gradually unlock and perceive the mysteries of the temple and surrounding areas. Exploring the temple will shape his dreams and eventually the Shaman will be able to enter a final dream, where he can ascend and achieve his Spirit Quest.

Gameplay details:

The basic gameplay consists of adventuring in a procedurally generated dream world, accessed by meditating, and progressing in the temple and surrounding areas in the waking world. Initially even the temple entrance is locked, but as the Shaman meditates and gains power in the dream world, he will be able to enter the temple and gradually progress.

In order to do this, the Shaman must meditate at a campfire to enter a 'dream world' in the form of a spirit animal of one's choice, each with different skills and stats. Adventuring and fighting monsters in the dream world nets the player (among other things) spirit power and insight, which unlocks places and features in the Shaman's waking world. The player has a limited amount of time to travel in the dream world, depending on how much total spirit power he has.

How the player progresses in the temple will also affect the dream world, constantly shaping it. The first dream world is a forest, but eventually the Shaman will be able to unlock other dreams, containing different animals, monsters and other dangers. The player may also find items in the temple, which he can use at the campsite to shape the dreams. The goal is to reach the final dream, which will allow the player to ascend and win the game.

Skills, experience, level ups:

The player's animal form will get exp and levels, which will grant it new skills. In the waking world the Shaman plays as himself and may not transfer into the spirit animal form, but can instead use the skills learned from the spirit animals. The player starts with only one spirit form, but will be able to learn others as he encounters and fights new creatures, both in the dreams and in the waking world. Initially the player can choose from three spirit animals on new game, but as he unlocks new forms they are unlocked for following playthroughs.

In addition, the Shaman gains experience in the waking world as he explores the temple. When he levels up, he gains increases to his basic stats, but new skills are only learned when the animal form levels up. Thus the player has to level up both his animal forms and himself as a fighter.

Example: player chooses Crow as his spirit animal. In the waking world, the Shaman now knows Crow form lvl 1, which grants him an ability "Summon Crow: summon a crow to aid you in a fight". When the Shaman enters the dream world, he will assume the Crow form which has the following abilities: "Swoop: 2d3, extra dmg on small targets" and "Reveal: reveal an area of radius 8 around you, may reveal secrets". The skill "Summon Crow" is only usable by the Shaman in the waking world.

As the player fights monsters in the dream world and gains experience, his Crow form will level up. At level 2, the Crow will teach the Shaman the skill "Reveal", which he may then use in the waking world. As the Shaman encounters and fights different animals, he may learn their forms and thus learn different skills from them. When he enters the dream world, he may assume the form of any of the learned animal forms, which gain experience independently.

Death & dying:

The game currently features permadeath, but new animal forms may be unlocked for subsequent playthroughs. At the moment, deaths in the dream world and the waking world are permanent. However, as more content gets implemented, this may be revised so that the player has limited amount of lives (3?) in the dream world before he dies permanently, while dying in the waking world is always permanent. Dying in the dream world would possibly incur some penalties to skills/experience/stats.
